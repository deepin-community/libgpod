libgpod (0.8.3-16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * QA upload

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Bump debhelper from old 11 to 12.
  * Set upstream metadata fields: Archive.
  * Apply multi-arch hints:
    - libgpod-dev is Multi-Arch: same
    - libgpod-cil-dev is Multi-Arch: same

  [ Alexander Volkov ]
  * Don't build CLI bindings when nocil build profile is enabled

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Preferentially (build-)depend on libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev.
    This package doesn't need the deprecated Xlib integration that is also
    pulled in by the older libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev package (see #974870).
  * Remove remnants of libgpod4-nogtk
  * d/libgpod4.symbols: Add Build-Depends-Package field
  * Set Rules-Requires-Root to no
  * Resolve file conflicts between -dev and -doc packages.
    The move to debhelper compat level 11 moved the documentation from
    /usr/share/doc/libgpod-doc to /usr/share/doc/libgpod-dev, but this
    is incompatible with /u/s/d/libgpod-dev being a symlink to
    /u/s/d/libgpod4. Instead, install the examples in /u/s/d/libgpod-doc
    with a symlink in /usr/s/d/libgpod4.
  * d/upstream/metadata: Add details of bug tracking and git repo

libgpod (0.8.3-10) unstable; urgency=medium

libgpod (0.8.3-8.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Correctly migrate /usr/share/doc/libgpod-nogtk-dev from symlink
    to directory. Saving a few KiB by changing it back to a symlink
    does not seem worthwhile when this is a transitional package that
    can be removed shortly after. (Closes: #859588)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Apr 2017 09:33:15 +0100

libgpod (0.8.3-8.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Convert "no GTK" packages into transitional packages that depend on
    the full version. They were requested in #386715 to avoid a GTK
    dependency, but now the only thing they avoid is gdk-pixbuf, and
    there is no user of libgpod in Debian that does not already depend
    on gdk-pixbuf anyway. The extra complexity caused the binary packages
    to be non-reproducible, and sometimes made Recommends uninstallable.
    (Closes: 838116)
  * Add missing build-dependency on dh-python (for dh_python2)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Mar 2017 11:18:06 +0100

  * [5c4dc2b] Tighten libgpod-common dependency.
    Recommend libgpod-common instead of suggesting it in the case of
    libgpod4-nogtk. This standardizes the dependency on libgpod-common between

libgpod (0.6.0-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add missing dependency of python-gpod on python-gobject.
    Thanks to Alessio Treglia for reporting. Closes: #506525,
    LP: #271106.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0:
    + Add debian/README.source

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Dec 2008 16:52:59 +0100

libgpod (0.6.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dh_lintian to install lintian overrides
    + Increase debhelper build-dep to >= 6.0.7
  * Increase debhelper compat level to 6
  * Move documentation and examples from libgpod-common to
    libgpod-doc, so that people who don't need that don't
    get it automatically via the Recommends of libgpod-common
    by libgpod3. Add a Suggests on the new package from the
    -dev packages. (Closes: #486382).
  * Further reduce unnecessary duplication by removing the -dev
    packages' usr/share/doc directories in favor of symlinks
    to the corresponding directories in the library packages.
    The already have a '=' dependency anyway.
  * 25_xsltproc-nonet: New patch to add a -nonet argument to
    the xsltproc call. Which shows that a build-dependency
    on docbook-xml was missing.
  * Previously all packages used the same short description
    which was somewhat confusing. Try to disambiguate this.

libgpod (0.6.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add symbols files for dpkg-gensymbols
  * When running dh_shlibdeps, use libgpod3-nogtk instead of libgpod3;
    this makes libgpod3-nogtk and libgpod-common co-installable. Patch by
    Steve Langasek via Ubuntu.
  * 30_fix_photo_for_classic_and_nano_video: Backported fix from upstream.
    By Patrick Ammann.

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Thu, 01 May 2008 00:36:23 +0200

libgpod (0.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add build-dependency on xsltproc to include API documentation in
    the gpod.py file.
  * Don't try to build the hal callout on kfreebsd, because it fails
    to build there.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes).
  * s/python/Python/ in python-gpod's Description as demanded by lintian.

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 2008 22:34:03 +0200

libgpod (0.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * 20_no-superfluous-ffi-dep:
    Only use PYGOBJECT_LIBS in bindings/python. This avoids a spurious
    dependency on libffi. Reported by Kurt Roeckx. Closes: #452829
  * 10_allow-autoreconf: Make autoreconf work which is needed for
    20_no-superfluous-ffi-dep to take effect.
  * Change priority of the -nogtk variants to extra since they conflict
    with the full variants and optional packages should not conflict
    with each other. Pointed out by debcheck.

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Nov 2007 22:29:30 +0100

libgpod (0.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Redo build system without cdbs.
  * Both based on a patch by Sune Vuorela, thanks.

libgpod (0.4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #389704)
    + Since this breaks the ABI without changing the soname
      but I want to upload this to experimental until a
      fixed upstream is available, rename libgpod0 to
      libgpod0.4.0 for the time being and conflict with
      libgpod0.
    + Add python-eyed3 (>= 0.6.6) to build-depends
      (Closes: #391556)
    + Adapt python-gpod to new python bindings build system
      (Closes: #374091)
    + Should fix reported segfaults (Closes: #369158, #374356)
    + Update copyright file
  * Bump pycompat to 2 (and bump build-depends accordingly)
  * Install the test scripts to libgpod-common as examples

libgpod (0.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #358561)

    strict dependency currently, don't use Depends. (Closes: #358732)
  * Make python bindings usable. Patch by Thomas Perl based on
    a patch by Abaakouk Mehdi. I have not really tested this,
    feedback welcome... (Closes: #360807)

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Apr 2006 21:07:34 +0200

libgpod (0.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libgpod-common package back from Ubuntu packaging after
    Sebastian Bacher pointed out that this indeed makes sense
    because we loose the possibility to install more than one
    version of the library otherwise.

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Mar 2006 01:08:00 +0100

libgpod (0.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add libgtk2.0-dev and libglib2.0-dev to dependencies of
    libgpod-dev since these are in fact needed. (Closes: #353590)
  * Use high urgency for trivial RC bug fix.

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Jan 2006 08:05:03 +0100

libgpod (0.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some changes to the build-depends (as suggested
    by Christian Marillat):
    + Add libgtk2.0-dev since that is needed for
      artkwork support (Closes: #345534)
    + Replace build-depends on libxml-parser-perl with
      dependency on intltool since that is what we really want
      (Closes: #345543)

 -- Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Jan 2006 19:05:49 +0100

libgpod (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian Release (Closes: #345160)
    - This is essentially the Ubuntu packaging therefor I include
      the Ubuntu changelog up to this point
  * Changes to the Ubuntu packaging:
    + Don't build-depend on packages not available in unstable yet
      (drop libhal-dev and libdbus-glib-1-dev)
    + change maintainer address to me
    + make copyright file a little more verbose and exact
    + update debhelper compat level to 5
    + drop libgpod-common package. Just too small for my taste
